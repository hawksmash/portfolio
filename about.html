<p>My name is Jabari Hawk im from Philadelphia and I a
    m an only child. I love to watch sports aand watch mo
    vies and listen to music. I love biographies and Action/comedy movies. I am inspired by people such as Bill ga
    tes and Barack Obama. I look up to them because they became successful not because they were privlaged but bec
    ause they worked hard and never gave up. They also give back to people in need and that is what type of 
    impact I want to have on the world.My goals in life are to become successful and be just like Bill Gates 
    and Barack Obama.I want to take care of my family and give back to my community.   </p>
